Open In-App Billing
=====

Uploading Android apps to all the existing Android appstores is a painful process and AppDF project was designed to make it easier.
But what is even more difficult for the developers is supporting different in-purchase SDKs of different appstores. 
There are several different In-App Purchase SDKs already and this number is increasing. 
We are going to create an open source library that will wrap appstore in-app purchase APIs of all the stores and 
provide an easy way for the developers to develop their apps/games in a way that one APK will work in all the 
stores and will automatically use right in-app purchase API under each store. 
Plus we are going to develop open in-app billing API that stores could implement to support all the APK files 
built using this library.

Current Status
=====
We have just started. We are creating a sample game that supports in-app billing of all existing appstores that support in-app purchasing.

AppStores
=====
The following Android application stores support in-app billing today:
 * Google Play
 * Amazon AppStore
 * Samsung Apps
 * SK-Telecom T-Store  
 
If you know about other Android appstores that support in-app purchasing please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/opf_openiab)
